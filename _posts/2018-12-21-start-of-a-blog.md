title: I decided to start a blog
---

I spend most of my time at work reading scientific journals, processing data, making visualizations, and generally doing science. I end up spending a lot of my free time learning new technologies and trying to find ways to apply them to the questions that interest me. Over the years I've found that my approach to doing science has drawn heavily from computer and data science blogs that I've read and sought inspiration from, and realized I should dive in and contribute as well. I hope that in sharing snippits of what I've recently learned, as applied to the contemporary problems I tackle as a research scientist, I can solidify new concepts or applications for myself and finally pay it forward for others.
