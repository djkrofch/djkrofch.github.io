I am a research assistant professor at the University of New Mexico, Department of Biology, working out of the
[Earth Systems Ecology Lab](http://www.HurteauLab.org). 
I have spent my academic and research career developing an understanding and appreciation of the
complexity of natural systems, and the the data we collect to investigate them. I love asking quesitons
and developing ways to answer them, making use of everything from field observations and models to imagery
from UAVs and satellites.

Over the past five years, I have focused my research on how change in the structure of 
semi-arid ecosystems affects how the landscape interacts with light, water, and energy â€“ 
specifically, I studied how those relationships manifest when viewed remotely using satellite data. 
During my PhD, I addressed these questions using combinations of in-situ measurements, 
remote sensing data, and empirical modeling. 

Currently, I am interested in how changes in drought, 
wildfire, and management regimes alter forest structure and composition across a 
larger diversity of vegetation and climatic gradients. I am also actively involved
in developing new approaches to integrating the broad diversity of rapidly growing data sets
that researchers collect using geospatial and remote sensing techniques, specifically leveraging
data from UAVs.
